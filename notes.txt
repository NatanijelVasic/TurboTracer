> float accuracy: i need to prevent re-intersections with the current triangle. 1.0e-9 gives a bug, 1.0e-6 doesn't ?

> tidy

> clip HDR

> weight vertex normals by tri area?

> check ray normalizations

> multithread CPU bounce loop

> normal smoothing for inner glass bounces?

> glass bug, dark areas inside glass

> check GPU branch behaviour

> multi-iterations for deeper bounces, to reduce GPU overhead 

> Metal memory streamlining 

> general camera raycast equation

> jittery edges even with AA because of high light intensity clipping
